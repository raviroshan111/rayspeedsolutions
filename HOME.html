        Our main focus is to provide superior services to our customers, meeting high standards of quality.
        In geophysics, a number of non-invasive techniques are used to observe the features of the Earth's
        subsurface. In most cases, the characteristics of the buried material can be identified based on the their
        behavior (such as radio waves, seismic waves, electrical properties etc.) as they interact with the material
        concerned.

        By Using direct investigation like bore wells, mining's can provide information regarding underground
        objects only to particular excavated locations. However, by using electromagnetic waves we can get a regular
        profile of the subsurface imaging for locating underground objects.

        Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) is one of those techniques which used radar waves to exploration of
        underground utilities.</p>
